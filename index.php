			<div id="bio">Hi I'm Taylor.<br /><br />I am an Android Developer. In my free time I enjoy photography, cooking and outdoor activities.
				<br /><br />I also really enjoy travelling. I just got back from France and Belgium a few weeks ago, and that was awesome.
				<br /><br />I tend to just use TextPad to edit HTML and CSS manually and check it with validators later. Not much of an IDE guy when it comes to markup.
